# Cats-and-Dogs-using-CNN---Deep-Learning
This project used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The dataset was preprocessed into NumPy arrays, with image augmentation techniques applied. The CNN model extracted features using convolutional layers and classified images, achieving high accuracy.
